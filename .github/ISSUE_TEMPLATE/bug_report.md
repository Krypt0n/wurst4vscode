**Most important:**
Make sure your issues belong into this repository.
The wurst4vscode is a super lightweight extension for VSCode, that only communicates with the language server from the main repo: https://github.com/wurstscript/WurstScript

Unless you really have plugin specific issues like "Language Client not starting" or incorrect highlighting, post the issue in the appropriate repository. Everything else like compiling, auto complete, quickfixes, buildig, running, is not related to the plugin. The plugin only sends these commands to the language server. If it's really a plugin issue, continue onwards.
